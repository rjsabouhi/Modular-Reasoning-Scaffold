# Modular Reasoning Scaffold (MRS)

A lightweight, model-agnostic meta-reasoning layer that gives small language models the ability to perform stable, multi-step recursive reasoning.

## Features

- Structured recursion nodes  
- Drift monitoring and stabilization  
- State slots (persistent intermediate memory)  
- Constraint layers  
- Topology engine for flow, branching, and halting  
- Fully transparent + interpretable reasoning chain

## Documentation

- **README**: Overview, installation, and usage  
- **MRS v1.0 PDF**: Full formal specification and math core  
- API docs coming soon
